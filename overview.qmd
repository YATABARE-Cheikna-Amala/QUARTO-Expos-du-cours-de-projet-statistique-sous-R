# Installation

Most of this part is done on the [official website](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) of Quarto.
Please, refer to the website.

* Download the appropriate QuartoCLI for your system on the website

<img src="img/illustration_download_quartocli_win.png" alt="Illustration download QuartoCLI for windows" class="img_1">

Here is an example of what you are supposed to get for a windows configuration.

* Once the download completed, you need to run the downloaded file on your computer

<img src="img/illustration_run_quartocli_win.png" alt="Illustration run QuartoCLI for windows"  class="img_2">

Now you just have to follow the steps according to what you want yourself and finish it.
Of course, we are continuing the example for a windows system.

You might run into issues for this part. Please refer to the documentation on the [website](https://quarto.org/)

<p class="special_p">That's it! You've successfully installed Quarto on your computer</p>

Now let's start doing the interesting part. We want to write some code, do some nice presentation, documents, pdfs and even websites like this one.

First things first, we need to choose our favorite development tool/editor or our mix of editor.

## VSCode

After installing Visual Studio Code, you need to install the quarto extension to be able to build a project with it.

<img src="img/illustration_download_quarto_vscode.png" alt="Illustration download quarto extension for visual studio code"  class="img-illu-quarto vscode">

On VSCode, things are pretty simple. To create a quarto document, you just need to give it the correct extension (`qmd`).

Quarto can render multiple formats on Visual Studio Code (pdf, html, word etc.)
In addition to that, it is possible in a Quarto file to render a Jupyter Notebook as a `.qmd` file or `.ipynb` file.

We will later on, cover how specifically we [preview]() and [render]() files with Quarto on VS Code.

## RStudio

The minimal version of R Studio that has support to Quarto is `RStudio v2022.07`. Later versions of R Studio are also good candidates. We will not go through the [installation](https://cran.rstudio.com/) of RStudio itself. We assume you to understand how it is done.

### Creating documents

To create a Quarto document, you go to: `File:New file: Quarto Document`.
And again for a Quarto Presentation, you select the appropriate button `Quarto Presentation`.

We will, later on, cover how specifically we [preview]() and [render]() files with Quarto on RStudio.

## Jupyter Lab

Jupyter Lab is a little bit different because we use it to create `.ipynb` files. But Quarto is integrated in Jupyter Lab so that it is possible to write YAML options to knit a notebook.
Here we do not need to create a `.qmd` file since it will knited to our desired format anyway

The code, we are going to be kniting into a html format (It is also possible to knit it to other formats):
<img src="img/illustration_demo_quarto_jupyterlab.png" alt="Illustration demo quarto on Jupyter lab"  class="img-illu-quarto demo-jupyterlab">

This is the code used by Quarto site themselves.

As you can see, we created a YAML header first like in any `.qmd` file and then we we wrote down markdown code befor our python chunk. We will, later on, cover how to preview and render those files on Juypterlab.

## Neovim

In Neovim, you can just create a new `.qmd` like in RStudio and the write basic quarto code.
Here is what the UI should look like:

Neovim's case is a little bit special. Most of you all should not be very familiar with Neovim but if you want to understand better using quarto in Neovim, please visit [this page](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/neovim.html) on Quarto website
